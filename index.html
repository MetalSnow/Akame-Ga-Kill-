        <h2>&#9680; アAkame ga Kill! アカメが斬る! &#9681;</h2>
        <p>
          Tatsumi is a fighter who is accompanied by his two childhood friends,
          Iyeyasu and Sayo, and sets off into the Capital to search of a way to
          make money in order to assist his poverty-stricken village. After
          being separated from his friends in a bandit attack, Tatsumi
          unsuccessfully attempts to enlist in the army and is swindled out of
          his money in the Capital. He is taken in by a noble family, but when
          an assassin group called Night Raid attacks, he learns that his noble
          hosts actually intended to torture and kill him as they had done to
          his friends. As a result, he joins Night Raid, which consists of the
          swordswoman Akame, the beastly fighter Leone, the self-proclaimed
          sniper genius Mine, the scissor-wielding Sheele, the string
          manipulator Lubbock, the armored warrior Bulat, and their leader
          Najenda, a former general of the imperial army. Night Raid is also
          part of the revolutionary forces assembled to overthrow the Prime
          Minister Honest who is manipulating the young emperor for his personal
          gain despite the rest of the nation falling to poverty and strife.
        </p>
        <p>
          The members of Night Raid carry Teigu (帝具, anime: Imperial Arms),
          unique weaponry created 900 years ago out of extremely rare materials
          as well as legendary animals called Danger Beasts (危険種, kikenshu).
          The power of the Teigu is so overwhelming that it is said that when
          two Teigu users fight each other, at least one of them is bound to
          die. Although Night Raid successfully assassinate some of Honest's
          cohorts, they lose Sheele during a fight against capital garrison
          member Seryu and then Bulat when Honest recruits the Empire's sadist
          general Esdeath and her Three Beasts. Tatsumi receives Bulat's Teigu,
          Incursio, as a result while Esdeath replaced her slain subordinates
          with a group of Teigu-using warriors called the Jaegers. Night Raid,
          along with new recruits Susanoo (a humanoid Teigu owned by Najenda)
          and Chelsea, fight the Jaegers with Seryu, Wave, and Akame's younger
          sister Kurome among its ranks. Over time, the two factions gradually
          lose some of their members.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the revolution gains momentum, Honest forms a new secret police
          force, the Wild Hunt, led by his own son, Syura. But Wild Hunt heavily
          abuses its authority by killing innocent civilians for their own
          plans, antagonizing both the Jaegers and Night Raid. Mine was almost
          killed by Seryu's suicide bomb attack, but she was saved by Tatsumi.
          After a battle between Wild Hunt and the Jaegers, with casualties from
          both sides, Esdeath blackmails Honest into dissolving the rest of Wild
          Hunt. Syura is killed by Lubbock after he captures both him and
          Tatsumi. Lubbock is killed while attempting to escape, and Tatsumi is
          sentenced to death despite Esdeath's attempts to save his life. The
          remaining Night Raid members attack the execution site to rescue
          Tatsumi while being pursued by the imperial general Budo, who Mine
          manages to kill at the cost of her Teigu while falling into a coma.
          Due to the stress he experienced while escaping the execution site,
          Tatsumi caused Incursio to transform. It would be revealed that
          Tatsumi caused the Danger Beast which Incursio was created from,
          Tyrant, to awaken with the doctor predicting that Tatsumi can use his
          Teigu a few more times left before it fully fuses onto his body and
          consumes him. As this occurs, Night Raid confronts the last members of
          Wild Hunt and finish them off, with Akame taking out big generals on
          the Empire's side. Akame leaves a message to Wave that she and Kurome
          intend to settle things as they promised each other. After his attempt
          to convince Kurome not to get through with it, fighting his way
          through Tatsumi, Wave manages to stop the sisters' duel and destroys
          Kurome's Teigu. With this, Wave and Kurome fake their deaths as they
          run off to start a new life together.
        </p>
        <p>
          To confront the emperor's Teigu, Tatsumi uses his last transformation
          to defeat it with Wave's help while changing into Tyrant. Before being
          fully consumed, Tatsumi asks Akame to kill him before he loses control
          and kills everyone. She does so during her battle with Esdeath, later
          revealed to have only killed the Danger Beast's soul so Tatsumi can
          live, managing to defeat the general at the cost of her own sword.
          Esdeath acknowledges her loss and uses her power to commit suicide
          while regretting that she never got Tatsumi to return her feelings. As
          the final battle unfolded, Honest attempted to flee before being
          mortally wounded by Leone after he fatally wounded her and she fused
          with the remains of her Teigu to give her enough time to capture him
          so the Revolutionary War can fully end; Afterwards, Leone dies
          peacefully. As Honest is later brutally executed with slow
          dismemberment for his crimes against the people, the Emperor accepts
          his own public execution while taking responsibility for his inaction
          as Najenda begins to rebuild their nation into better place. Tatsumi,
          still trapped in his dragon form, returns to his village with Mine
          after she recovered and gave birth to their child, who was conceived
          prior to Mine's coma. Kurome and Wave end up together as well, with
          the former still scarred by her past while the latter lost one of his
          internal organs as a price for using two Teigu at once. As for Akame,
          still working as an assassin to defend the restoring nation from those
          who would exploit it, she heads eastward to protect her nation and
          find a means to restore Tatsumi's human form and to find a cure for
          the pain in her body from Murasame's Trump Card; where the events of
          Hinowa ga Crush! take place.
